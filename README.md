# SCOUT Project

SCOUT (Surveillance-Controlled Unmanned Tracker) is an autonomous robot designed for mapping environments and navigating using a ToF (Time-of-Flight) camera and odometry. This project showcases how to log sensor data, process maps, and control SCOUT for real-time exploration and obstacle avoidance.

## **Features**
- **Environmental Mapping**: Uses a ToF camera to capture depth data and create 2D maps.
- **Odometry Integration**: Tracks robot movement and updates map data dynamically.
- **Data Logging**: Logs sensor readings to a CSV file for later processing.
- **Web Interface**: Interactive web-based control and data visualization.
- **Script Automation**: Modular scripts for data logging, map processing, and odometry updates.
